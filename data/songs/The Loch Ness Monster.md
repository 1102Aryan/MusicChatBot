Matilda Mann - 2020
-----------
###Verse 1
I'm just swimming in lakes, in my mind
Don't make me get out and comply
And my coy little smile will defend me a while
So I'll stay with the lakes in my mind
Don't you dare think that here you can hide
We all started to stray, nothing lasts anyway
So I'll stay with the lakes in my mind

###Chorus
And now you've faded with no traces
So, who could ever tell?
What you've taken's been misplaced
But your name doesn't ring any bells
Since the day that they took you to hell

I'm just swimming in lakes, in my mind
Too afraid to get out and deny
And my coy little smile with defend me a while
So I'll stay with the lakes in my mind

###Chorus
And now you've faded with no traces
So, who could ever tell?
What you've taken's been misplaced
But your name doesn't ring any bells
Since the day that they took you to hell

What's it like there in hell?
Glad they left you in hell
Stay right down there in hell

###Outro
So I'll stay with the lakes in my mind
Don't you dare think that here you can hide
